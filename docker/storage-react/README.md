# reactAppTest1-

This is React app with version 17 and router version 5

From package.json:

    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2",
    "react-router-dom": "^5.3.0",

There is new version of all of that (18 and 6) but i was using Chatgpt to generate it and it doesn't know newer version.

Later will try to migrate, but for now at least it works.
